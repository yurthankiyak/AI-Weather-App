# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).


# AI Weather Forecast App

This project uses OpenWeather and OpenAI APIs. To run the app, you need to add your own API keys.


## API Keys Setup

This app currently requires you to add your API keys **directly inside the source code** at:

AI-Weather-App-main\app(tabs)\index.tsx

csharp
Kopyala
D√ºzenle

Open the file and replace the placeholder API keys with your own:

```ts
const OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = 'your_openweather_api_key_here';
const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key_here';
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This method is not secure for production apps.
For better security, consider using environment variables (.env) in future versions.





## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your API keys in the `.env` file like this:

3. Make sure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` so your keys won‚Äôt be committed.
4. Run the app normally (e.g., `npm start` or `expo start`).

If you don't have API keys, register at:  
- [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)  
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
